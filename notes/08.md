- streams: high level API
- transport and protocol: low-level API

As an example, if we’re designing a networking library or web framework, we may consider transports
and protocols.

For most applications, we don’t need this level of control, and using
transports and protocols would involve us writing a bunch of repetitive code.
This API encapsulates the standard use cases of transports and protocols into two
classes that are easy to understand and use: StreamReader and StreamWriter.

ANSI escape codes are special codes we can write to standard out performing actions like changing the color of text,
moving the cursor up or down, and deleting lines.

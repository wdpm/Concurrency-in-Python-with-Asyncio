 # 13 Managing subprocesses

- Running multiple subprocesses asynchronously
- Handling standard output from subprocesses
- Communicating with subprocesses using standard input
- Avoiding deadlocks and other pitfalls with subprocesses

In this chapter, we’ll learn the basics of creating and managing subprocesses with
asyncio by running an application written in a different language. We’ll also learn how
to handle input and output, reading standard output, and sending input from our
application to our subprocesses.

asyncio provides two coroutine functions out of the box to create subprocesses: 
- asyncio.create_subprocess_shell
- asyncio.create_subprocess_exec

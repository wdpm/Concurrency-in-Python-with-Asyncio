# 14 Advanced asyncio
- Designing APIs for both coroutines and functions
- Coroutine context locals
- Yielding to the event loop
- Using different event loop implementations
- The relationship between coroutines and generators
- Creating your own event loop with custom awaitables

## APIs for both coroutines and functions
```python
for task in self.tasks:
    if asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(task):
        awaitable_tasks.append(asyncio.create_task(task()))
    elif asyncio.iscoroutine(task):
        awaitable_tasks.append(asyncio.create_task(task))
    else:
        # to schedule our plain function to run on the next iteration of the event loop
        self.loop.call_soon(task)
```

## Coroutine context locals

Context variables are similar to thread locals with the difference being that
**they are local to a particular task instead of to a thread.**

## Forcing an event loop iteration

```python
await asyncio.sleep(0)
```
这句可以触发event loop iteration。

## Using different event loop implementations

uvloop is an implementation
of an event loop that heavily relies on the libuv library (https://libuv.org)
> Note that at the time
of writing, uvloop is only available on *Nix platforms.'

## Creating a custom event loop

### Custom awaitables

See class `CustomFuture`, implement custom awaitable.
